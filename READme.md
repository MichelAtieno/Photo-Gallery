### Description
 As a user of the application, you are able to:
<ul>
    <li>View different photos that interest me.</li>
    <li>Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo details appear on a modal within the same route as the home page.</li>
    <li>Search for different categories of photos. (ie. Hair, Food)</li>
    <li>Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends.</li>
    <li>View photos based on the location they were taken.</li>
<ul>

### Behaviors

<ol>
    <li>The project has an admin dashboard that is used to post photos to the database and manage the photos.</li>
    <li>When a user clicks on an Image he/she is redirected to the modal where they can click on the link, "View Full-Size photo", then a larger version of the image is displayed.</li>
    <li>The project has a search form that when submitted calls a search function in the view function and redirects to a search results page.</li>
